The PyOS Module is meant for the PyOS Operating system, and can only call functions within the PyOS Operating system.

This module cannot call any functions on Windows, or Linux, as these have different hidden names for these functions that this calls on PyOS.
You can still write your code on VSCode with the PyOS VM.
